    Since eighth grade, I’ve participated in the
    <a href="http://www.studentcam.org/"
      >C-SPAN StudentCam Documentary Competition</a
    >
    on various topics, ranging from healthcare and education spending expansion
    to immigration and social media regulation. Throughout this process, I’ve
    interviewed professors, industry experts, politicians, and fellow students
    like me. You can check out my documentaries below!

  <h2>Research</h2>

  <b
    >Student Researcher under Dr. Jonathan Gruber and Dr. Rena Conti (June 2021
    - Present)</b
  >

  <p>
    I'm currently working with
    <a href="https://www.bu.edu/questrom/profile/rena-conti/">Dr. Rena Conti</a>
    of Boston University, extracting and analyzing 500+ COVID vaccine clinical
    trial statistics on location, vaccine platforms, agreements, etc. I also
    researched Securities and Exchange Commission company filings to investigate
    the impacts of compulsory licensing, manufacturing contracts, and IP
    agreements on COVID vaccine development. Our research will be published in
    the pending paper, “The role of intellectual property protections in the
    development of COVID-19 vaccines”.

    I'm also working with
    <a href="https://economics.mit.edu/faculty/gruberj">Dr. Jonathan Gruber</a>
    of MIT to update the 7th Edition of

    workers.

    >Harvard International Economics Essay Contest (August 2020 - December
    2020)</b

  <p>
    Throughout the latter half of 2020, I conducted a meta-analysis and survey
    of existing research literature on the groupthink phenomenon, a subject
    within behavioral economics that occurs when the desire of harmony within a
    group overpowers standard reason and rational decision making. I summarized
    my findings in an essay:

      >"The Big Brother Watching Us Today: Groupthink”</a
    >.

    At
    <a
      href="https://fisher.wharton.upenn.edu/management-technology-summer-institute/"
      >M&TSI</a
    >, I was taught by Penn’s Wharton and SEAS professors alongside 90 students
    about various topics at the intersection between business, technology, and
    entrepreneurship. I studied Harvard Business School company case studies
    (LinkedIn, Dropbox, IDEO, etc.), attended seminars with entrepreneurs
    (Strella Biotech, Niantic, Lia, etc.), and developed my own product
    prototypes with Arduino circuits. After self-teaching basic C++, I created
    the circuit prototype, developed the
    <a href="https://cxguo8.wixsite.com/fulpillment">website</a>, and prepared
    the <a href="../assets/fulpillment.pdf">executive summary</a> for our
    product:
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-jorZO5SQs">FulPillment</a>, a
    synced app and pillbox duo that automatically keeps track of pill-taking and
    reminds the user to take/reorder them.

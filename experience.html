  <h2>Research</h2>

  <b
    >Student Researcher under Dr. Jonathan Gruber and Dr. Rena Conti (June 2021
    - Present)</b
  >
  <p>
    I'm currently working with
    <a href="https://economics.mit.edu/faculty/gruberj">Dr. Jonathan Gruber</a>
    of MIT to update the 7th Edition of his “Public Finance and Public Policy”
    textbook, the most-used public finance textbook in America. I'm also
    conducting analysis and compiling health insurance and retirement savings
    statistics of American workers.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm also working with
    <a href="https://www.bu.edu/questrom/profile/rena-conti/">Dr. Rena Conti</a>
    of Boston University, extracting and analyzing 500+ COVID vaccine clinical
    trial statistics on location, vaccine platforms, agreements, etc. I also
    researched Securities and Exchange Commission company filings to investigate
    the impacts of compulsory licensing, manufacturing contracts, and IP
    agreements on COVID vaccine development.

  <b
    >Harvard International Economics Essay Contest (August 2020 - December
    2020)</b
  >

  <p>
    Throughout the latter half of 2020, I conducted a meta-analysis and survey
    of existing research literature on the groupthink phenomenon, a subject
    within behavioral economics that occurs when the desire of harmony within a
    group overpowers standard reason and rational decision making. I summarized
    my findings in an essay:
    <a href="./assets/groupthink.pdf"
      >"The Big Brother Watching Us Today: Groupthink”</a
    >.
  </p>

  <b
    >Wharton Global High School Investment Competition (August 2020 - December
    2020)</b
  >
  <p>
    Alongside my teammates over the course of ten weeks, I developed my own
    investment portfolio strategy (nicknamed COMPASS) after reaching out to
    real-life trading experts and competing with a stock market simulator. In
    <a href="./assets/compass.pdf">this analysis</a>, I go over the strategy's
    stock-selecting methodology, as well as how it balances four factors (News,
    Earnings, World, and Stability).

  <h2>Academic Programs</h2>

  <b
    >University of Pennsylvania’s Management & Technology Summer Institute (July
    2021)</b
  >
  <p>
    At
    <a
      href="https://fisher.wharton.upenn.edu/management-technology-summer-institute/"
      >M&TSI</a
    >, I was taught by Penn’s Wharton and SEAS professors alongside 90 students
    about various topics in the intersection between business, technology, and
    entrepreneurship. I studied Harvard Business School company case studies
    (LinkedIn, Dropbox, IDEO, etc.), attended seminars with entrepreneurs
    (Strella Biotech, Niantic, Lia, etc.), and developed my own product
    prototypes with Arduino circuits. After self-teaching basic C++, I created
    the
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-jorZO5SQs">circuit prototype</a>,
    developed the <a href="https://cxguo8.wixsite.com/fulpillment">website</a>,
    and wrote the <a href="./assets/fulpillment.pdf">executive summary</a> for
    our product: FulPillment, a synced app and pillbox duo that automatically
    keeps track of pill-taking and reminds the user to take/reorder them.

  <h2>Debate</h2>
  <p>
    I’ve competed in Public Forum debate for seven years. Now, I’m Captain of
    the <a href="https://www.potomacdebate.com/">Potomac Debate Academy</a>’s
    400+ students and was a founder of my school’s national debate team. In
    debate, I’ve led research efforts, prepared cases, and debated domestic and
    foreign policy for national circuit tournaments, investigating topics
    including corporate regulation (e.g. compulsory licensing), federal
    budgeting (e.g. social spending), and international influence (e.g. military
    presence in the Persian Gulf).

  <h2>STEM</h2>
  <p>
    Having participated in my schools’ math and computer teams since middle
    school, I now lead over 150 students as Captain of the RMHS Math Team and
    Computer Team, where I create weekly presentations, lead team practices for
    tournaments, and teach members about various mathematical and computer
    science concepts (AMC 10/12 + AIME for math, and Python and Java for
    computer science).
  </p>
  <h2>DECA</h2>
  <p>
    Throughout high school, I participated in my school’s DECA team, choosing
    different divisions (marketing, finance, business law and ethics) to study a
    wide range of topics. Now, I’m Executive Vice President of the RMHS team,
    the second largest club in the school with over 200 members!
  </p>
  <h2>Student Goverment</h2>
  <p>
    Since freshman year, I’ve been a member of the RMHS Student Government
    Association’s Executive Board. As a Delegate Advisor, I coordinate
    representatives for our student body of 2,400 for monthly general
    assemblies. Previously, I also coded scripts to help streamline processes
    such as attendance tracking.

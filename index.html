    Hi! I'm Carina, and I'm a senior at

    >’s IB Program in Rockville, Maryland.

    I’m a research intern under

      >Professor Jonathan Gruber</a
    >
    of MIT and
    <a href="https://www.bu.edu/questrom/profile/rena-conti/"

    of Boston University, where I study compulsory licensing, pharmaceutical
    firm decision-making, public finance and policy, and COVID vaccine clinical
    trials. Over the past years, I’ve become an active member and leader in the

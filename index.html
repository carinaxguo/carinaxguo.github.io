  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>
    Hi, I'm Carina, and I'm a senior at the
    <a href="https://www2.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/schools/rmhs/"
      >Richard Montgomery High School</a
    >
    in Montgomery County, Maryland.
  </p>

  <p>
    Previously, I completed my undergrad at
    <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley</a> studying
    <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/">EECS</a>. I was an undergraduate
    researcher in the <a href="http://wifo.eecs.berkeley.edu/">BLISS</a> lab,
    working with PhD student
    <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vidya.muthukumar/"
      >Vidya Muthukumar</a
    >
    and
    <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sahai/">Professor Anant Sahai</a
    >. Before that, I was an undergraduate researcher in the
    <a href="https://maharbizgroup.wordpress.com/">Maharbiz Group</a>, working
    with PhD student Travis Massey and
    <a href="https://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/maharbiz.html"
      >Professor Michel Maharbiz</a
    >, as part of the
    <a href="https://swarmlab.eecs.berkeley.edu/">Swarm Lab</a>.

  <p>
    During my undergrad years at UC Berkeley, I was a lecturer / instructor on
    record for <a href="http://su18.cs61a.org/">CS 61A</a>. Before that, I was
    an undergraduate student instructor (uGSI) for CS 61A. Throughout my time
    there, I was also a uGSI for
    <a href="http://datastructur.es/sp17">CS 61B</a> and a tutor/reader for CS
    61B.

    I am from North Carolina, so I enjoy southern barbecue and any fried and
    buttery foods. In addition, I enjoy playing and watching basketball and
    football.
